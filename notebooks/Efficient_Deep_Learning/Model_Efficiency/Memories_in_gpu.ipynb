    "    2. Data Movement Between Different Memory Hierarchies:\n",
    "\n",
    "        * Accessing data from HBM might still incur some overhead due to the memory hierarchy (e.g., accessing global memory via HBM is slower than accessing Shared Memory or Registers which are on-chip).\n",
    "    \n",
    "        * The L2 cache is placed between global memory (HBM) and the SMs (Streaming Multiprocessors), and if data is not found in the L2 cache, it has to be fetched from HBM. This introduces additional latency compared to directly accessing Shared Memory or Registers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simplified Explanation of Access Speed:\n",
    "* HBM itself is very high bandwidth, meaning it can transfer large amounts of data per cycle, but it is still relatively slower than on-chip memories like Shared Memory or Registers. In deep learning, accessing data from HBM may involve some latency due to the physical distance from the processing cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Device Memory refers to the entire memory system (including global memory in HBM and other caches), so when referring to it in the table, the access speed is a bit slower than the raw bandwidth of HBM, since it may involve cache misses, memory controller delays, or other factors that can cause slightly longer access times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In summary:\n",
    "* HBM refers specifically to the high-bandwidth memory, which is very fast at transferring large amounts of data but is still not as fast as on-chip memory (like Shared Memory or Registers).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Device Memory in this context is a more general term that includes HBM, L2 cache, and global memory, and when data must travel through the memory hierarchy (e.g., from global memory or HBM to an SM or L2 cache), the access speed can vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### More Clarification on Access Speed in Practice:\n",
    "   * HBM has a high bandwidth (1555 GB/s) but global memory accesses to HBM still require some overhead in terms of access time.\n",
    "   * Device Memory in the table refers to the overall performance of global memory in HBM, which could include latency from L2 cache or L1 cache misses.\n",
